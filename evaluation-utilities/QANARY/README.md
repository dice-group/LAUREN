# A Reference Implementation for Creating Question Answering Systems following the Qanary Methodology
## Qanary in a Nutshell

Qanary is a methodology for creating Question Answering Systems it is part of the [WDAqua project](http://wdaqua.eu) where question answering systems are researched and developed. For all the publications related to Qanary please see the section [publications](#qanarypublications). W.r.t. questions, ideas or any feedback related to Qanary please do not hesitate to [contact the core developers](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary/wiki/Who-do-I-talk-to%3F). However, if you like to see a QA system built using the Qanary framework, one of our core developers has build a complete end-to-end QA system which allows to query several RDF data stores: http://wdaqua.eu/qa.

Please go to the [GitHub Wiki page](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary/wiki) of this repository to get more insights on how to use this framework, how to add new component etc.

Here, we provide our key contributions on-top of the [RDF vocabulary qa](https://github.com/WDAqua/QAOntology): the reference implementation of the Qanary methodology. This repository contributes several sub-resources for the Question Answering Community to build knowledge-driven QA systems incorporating a standard [RDF vocabulary named "qa"](https://github.com/WDAqua/QAOntology). 

All the resources are reusable. For detailed description of individual resources, kindly refer to Wiki section of this repository. The [Qanary Question Answering components](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-question-answering-components) maintained by the core developers are available [here](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-question-answering-components) (in a separated Git repository). They require to first clone this repository (of the Qanary framework) and execute ``mvn install``.
However, this is just the beginning, many more components will soon be published.

The following sub-project are part of the Qanary core frameworks:

 * [**Qanary Pipeline**](#qanarypipeline) implementation: a central component where components for question answering systems are connected automatically and can be called by Web UIs
 * Qanary component implementations: components providing wrappers to existing functionality or implement new question answering approaches
    * a [**Qanary component template**](#qanarycomponenttemplate) implementation: use this to build you own component ([howto](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary/wiki/How-do-I-create-a-new-Qanary-component%3F)) as it provides [several features]()
 * the additional resource [**QALD evaluator**](#qaldevaluator): a client for the Qanary Pipeline evaluating the capabilities w.r.t. named entity recognition and disambiguation of a given Qanary Pipeline configuration with the [QALD benchmark](http://qald.sebastianwalter.org/) (Question Answering over Linked Data) data
    * [**QALD annotated with named entities**](#qaldnerddataset): questions of [QALD](http://qald.sebastianwalter.org/) annotated with named entities containing

## Stuff used to make this:

 * [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) project


## How to run the code

How to build a complete *tiny Question Answering system* driven by Qanary is described [here](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-question-answering-components/blob/master/README.md#build-and-run-a-minimal-set-of-components).

### Without creating Docker images 

 1. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary`

 2. Install Java 8 or higher (see <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html> for details)

 3. Install Maven 3.5.2 or higher (see <https://maven.apache.org/install.html> for details)

 4. Install Stardog Triplestore (<http://stardog.com/>) and start it in background. Create a database with the name _qanary_. All the triples generated by the components will be stored in the _qanary_ database. We use version 7 of Stardog.

 5. Switch to Qanary directoy: `cd Qanary`
 
 6. Build the components (creating Docker images is skipped):
```
   mvn clean install -Ddockerfile.skip=true
```
 
 7. Run the pipeline component:
```
   cd qanary_pipeline-template/target/
   java -jar target/qa.pipeline-<version>.jar --qanary.triplestore=ENDPOINT-OF-YOUR-TRIPLESTORE
```

   * while using Stardog on your local system using the default configuration you might use as triplestore endpoint: `http://admin:admin@localhost:5820/YOUR-DATABASE-NAME` (of course, you have to create a database by yourself)
  
 8. After running corresponding component JAR files, you can see Spring Boot application running on <http://localhost:8080/#/overview> that will tell the status of currently running components.
   * To run components you need to build and run Qanary components, see the components repository for details: [Qanary Question Answering components](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-question-answering-components)

 9. Now your pipeline is ready to use. Go to <http://localhost:8080/startquestionansweringwithtextquestion>. Here you can find a User Interface to interact for adding question via web interface, and then select the components you need to include in the pipeline via checking a checkbox for each component. Press the start button and you are ready to go!


### Including the creation of Docker instances

 * Follow the steps described in the previous section.

 * Install the Docker environment (see <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/> for details)
 
 * Start the Docker service (see <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/> for details)

 * Build your project using maven: `mvn clean install` (note: you might also add `-Ddockerfile.skip=false` to express that Docker images are created)
   * The _install_ goal will compile, test, and package your projectâ€™s code and then copy it into the local dependency repository. Additionally, it will generate docker images for each component that will be stored in your local repository.
   
 * Start the Qanary Docker containers.
   
 * Now your pipeline is ready to use. Go to <http://localhost:8080/startquestionansweringwithtextquestion>. Here you can find a User Interface to interact for adding question via web interface, and then select the components you need to include in the pipeline via checking a checkbox for each component. Press the start button and you are ready to go!
 
 
 ### Using Qanary for your work
 
 * Our Wiki page contains all the information about how to integrate a new component and also about the easy usability of Qanary framework. We have illustrated inclusion of a new component with example in Wiki page. Please refer to it.
